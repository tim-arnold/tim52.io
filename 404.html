        <p>Sorry, but the page you were trying to find does not exist.</p>
        <p>I am terribly sorry for how that may make you feel, but imagine how the page feels! It was just sitting there, minding its own business and feeling completely confident that it was a real page, when you came along and forced it to reckon with the fact of it's non-existence.</p>
        <p><em>I hope you're proud of yourself, Curtis.</em></p>
        <p><a href="/">Head to the homepage</a>. It is, after all, the only page. I'm honestly not even sure you you got here.</p>
